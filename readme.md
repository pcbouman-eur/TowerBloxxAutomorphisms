# Enumeration of Graph Automorphisms with an application to Tower Bloxx

This is some Java code that can be used to generate automorphisms of a graph.
The algorithm is not very sophisticated, but it works fine for small graphs.

There is also an application for enumeration of states of the game Tower Bloxx.
As this game works with square grids, states have many symmetries that can
be ignored while performing an enumeration.
